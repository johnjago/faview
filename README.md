# Faview, the live favicon preview tool

Faview is a website where you can select an image from your computer, and it
will show that image as a favicon in the current browser tab.

Everything is done in the browser—the images aren’t uploaded anywhere.

Try it out at [faview.johnjago.com](https://faview.johnjago.com).

## Why I made this

When choosing a favicon for a website, I sometimes want to first see how it
will appear in a real browser tab, without actually adding the image to the
project.
